# HairLytic-Part-1
Hairlytic is a structured, camera-guided diagnostic platform designed to help patients evaluate scalp and hair-loss conditions through a blend of questionnaires, computer-vision analysis, and guided live tests. The system produces an auto-generated diagnosis report that patients can download or share with dermatologists of their choice.
